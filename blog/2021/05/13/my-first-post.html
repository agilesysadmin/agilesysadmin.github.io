    <p>I didn&#39;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Stop it, stop it. It&#39;s fine. I will &#39;destroy&#39; you! You, a bobsleder!? That I&#39;d like to see! Kids have names?</p>

<p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. One hundred dollars. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. We can&#39;t compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! <strong>Ours is small and neutral!</strong> <em>Eeeee!</em> Now say &quot;nuclear wessels&quot;!</p>

</section>
<section id="section-2">
    <h2>Ow, my spirit!</h2>

<p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn&#39;t you just get me the death penalty? Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won&#39;t be sure you&#39;ve done anything at all. Well, let&#39;s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Who am I making this out to?</li>
<li>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There&#39;s only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</li>
<li>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Really?!</h3>

<p>Large bet on myself in round one. And why did &#39;I&#39; have to take a cab? What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Okay, I like a challenge.</p>

<ul>
<li>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</li>
<li>Well, thanks to the Internet, I&#39;m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</li>
<li>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! &#39;It is!&#39; My precious torso!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can crush me but you can&#39;t crush my spirit! Oh God, what have I done? Moving along… I meant &#39;physically&#39;. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>

<p>I found what I need. And it&#39;s not friends, it&#39;s things. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! I haven&#39;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m his friend Jesus. And yet you haven&#39;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Can we have Bender Burgers again? You&#39;ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you&#39;re partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>

<p>Why not indeed! You guys go on without me! I&#39;m going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Fetal stemcells, aren&#39;t those controversial? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p>

<p>Guess again. I meant &#39;physically&#39;. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>

<p>We&#39;re also Santa Claus! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No. We&#39;re on the top. Check it out, y&#39;all. Everyone who was invited is here. We&#39;ll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p>

<p>Is that a cooking show? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#39;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Pansy. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Ow, my spirit! You&#39;ve killed me! Oh, you&#39;ve killed me! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! No, I&#39;m Santa Claus! You&#39;ve killed me! Oh, you&#39;ve killed me!</p>

<p>Hey, guess what you&#39;re accessories to. I&#39;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. We don&#39;t have a brig. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I&#39;m still single? It&#39;s &#39;cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>

<p>Stop! Don&#39;t shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! That could be &#39;my&#39; beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Noooooo! Hey, what kinda party is this? There&#39;s no booze and only one hooker.</p>

<p>For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Well, let&#39;s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Ah, computer dating. It&#39;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &quot;upside your head.&quot;</p>
